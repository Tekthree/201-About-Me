          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> I was born in Springfield Ill. but quickly moved to Hawaii where I grow up watching surfers from my back yard. My dad was in the military so we were pretty taken care of. By the time I got around to high school my parents had relocated us more than 6 different times, ending all the way in Okinawa Japan. I joined the military from there and began to travel the world myself. Glad to have finally settled in the PNW. </p>
